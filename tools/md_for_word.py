"""Prepare a lab markdown file for conversion to .docx.

Word has no equivalent of a few things these documents use, so they are
rewritten rather than silently dropped by the converter:

  * <details>/<summary> collapsible blocks  -> a bold "spoiler" heading plus the
    content, with an explicit warning line, since Word cannot collapse.
  * links to sibling .md files              -> links to the .docx equivalents.
  * the emoji check/cross marks in tables   -> plain words, which render
    consistently in Word on Windows.

Usage: md_for_word.py <in.md> <out.md>
